# This file contains the definitions that can't be generated with go-swagger.
# The complete swagger file is computer generated and manually edited in order to
# speed up the API documentation creation.
#
# To generate the partial.yml file that merge this file and the comments in the source
# code, run: swagger generate spec -i ./doc/swagger/manual.yml -o ./doc/swagger/partial.yml
# 
# After that, we can find the errors in the generated file using swagger validate ./doc/swagger/partial.yml
# At the end of the review process, save the complete file to ./doc/swagger/swagger.yml
#
# partial.yml is excluded from the repo.
