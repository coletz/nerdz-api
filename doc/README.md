# NERDZ API

This folder contains the autogenerated structures that will be used only to build the swagger documentation.

To autogenerate the the `responses.go` file, you can run:

```sh
rts -server http://localhost:9090/v1 -pkg doc -headers "Authorization: Bearer _uZV-FCsS3-ytssqZC6qLw" -routes routes.txt -out responses.go
```

The command above uses the `routes.txt` file and an access token present in the test database.
`rts` is https://github.com/galeone/rts
