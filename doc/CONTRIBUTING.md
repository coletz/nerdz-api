NERDZ-API Developer's guide
===========================

The API is divided in 2 section: back-end and front-end.

The _back-end_ is placed into `/nerdz` folder. Its task is to communicate with the ORM to achieve the functionality of the NERDZ social network platform.

The _front-end_ is placed into `/api`. It contains the implementation of the HTTP server that is in charge of handling requests of authorization (using the OAuth2 protocol) and provide the required resources.

In this level we should define the format of request and response.
